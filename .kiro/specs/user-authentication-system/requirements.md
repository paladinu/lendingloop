# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a user authentication and registration system that will secure access to the shared items management application. The system will require users to authenticate before accessing any functionality and will include comprehensive user registration with email verification.

## Glossary

- **Authentication_System**: The software component responsible for verifying user identity through login credentials
- **Registration_System**: The software component that handles new user account creation
- **User_Session**: An authenticated state that persists user login status across application interactions
- **Email_Verification**: The process of confirming user email address ownership through a verification link or code
- **Password_Policy**: The set of rules governing acceptable password complexity and security requirements
- **User_Profile**: The collection of user information including personal details and authentication credentials

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the application, I want to be required to log in before accessing any functionality, so that the system is secure and only authorized users can view or manage items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the application, THE Authentication_System SHALL display a login screen before showing any item management functionality
2. WHILE a user is not authenticated, THE Authentication_System SHALL prevent access to item listing and creation features
3. IF a user attempts to access protected routes without authentication, THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL redirect them to the login screen
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL maintain user session state across browser refreshes and navigation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with my email address and password, so that I can securely access my account and the application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL provide input fields for email address and password on the login screen
2. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials, THE Authentication_System SHALL authenticate the user and grant access to the application
3. WHEN a user submits invalid login credentials, THE Authentication_System SHALL display an appropriate error message and prevent access
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL validate that the email address follows proper email format before processing login
5. WHILE login is being processed, THE Authentication_System SHALL display loading indicators and disable form submission

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my password to meet security requirements, so that my account is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Password_Policy SHALL require passwords to be at least 8 characters in length
2. THE Password_Policy SHALL require passwords to contain at least one lowercase letter
3. THE Password_Policy SHALL require passwords to contain at least one uppercase letter
4. THE Password_Policy SHALL require passwords to contain at least one special character
5. WHEN a user enters a password that does not meet requirements, THE Registration_System SHALL display specific validation messages indicating which criteria are not met

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account by providing my personal information, so that I can create a secure account and access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Registration_System SHALL provide input fields for email address, first name, last name, street address, and password
2. THE Registration_System SHALL validate that all required fields are completed before allowing registration submission
3. THE Registration_System SHALL validate that the email address is not already registered in the system
4. WHEN a user submits valid registration information, THE Registration_System SHALL create a new user account with unverified status
5. THE Registration_System SHALL apply password policy validation during registration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to verify my email address during registration, so that the system can confirm I own the email address and my account is properly activated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes registration, THE Email_Verification SHALL send a verification email to the provided email address
2. THE Email_Verification SHALL generate a unique verification token or link for each registration
3. WHEN a user clicks the verification link, THE Email_Verification SHALL activate the user account and mark the email as verified
4. WHILE a user account is unverified, THE Authentication_System SHALL prevent login and display appropriate messaging
5. THE Email_Verification SHALL provide a mechanism to resend verification emails if needed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to log out of the application, so that I can securely end my session when I'm finished using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL provide a logout option that is accessible from any authenticated screen
2. WHEN a user initiates logout, THE User_Session SHALL be terminated and all authentication tokens invalidated
3. WHEN logout is completed, THE Authentication_System SHALL redirect the user to the login screen
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL clear any stored session data from the browser upon logout

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user data to be securely stored and managed, so that user privacy is protected and the system meets security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL store passwords using secure hashing algorithms with salt
2. THE User_Profile SHALL store user personal information in encrypted format where appropriate
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL implement secure session management with appropriate timeout policies
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL log authentication events for security monitoring purposes
5. THE Registration_System SHALL validate and sanitize all user input to prevent security vulnerabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the toolbar with the user information and logout options to be a component that is reused on every page, so that I can log out from anywhere in the site without having to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL display a toolbar component containing user information on every authenticated page
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL include a logout option in the toolbar that is accessible from any authenticated screen
3. WHEN a user views any authenticated page, THE Authentication_System SHALL display the user's first name and last name in the toolbar
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL maintain consistent toolbar appearance and functionality across all pages
